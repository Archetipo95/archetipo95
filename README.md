# Hi there 👋 I'm Martin

## 👨🏼‍💻 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer deeply passionate about front-end development, with over 5 years of professional experience dedicated to crafting innovative and high-quality web solutions. Building on a solid foundation from my IT studies (high school and a bachelor's degree), I specialize in the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly **TypeScript**, **Vue.js**, and **Nuxt.js**. As a technical leader, I emphasize web accessibility (a11y), code maintainability, performance, and software quality through rigorous testing. I’m a firm believer in knowledge sharing and am passionate about mentoring and fostering team growth.

## 🏆 My Proudest Achievement

I'm particularly proud of my contributions as a **Lead Developer** and **QA Lead** on large-scale e-commerce projects for world-renowned brands like **Armani** and **Woolrich**. Leveraging Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and headless architectures, we significantly enhanced clients' ability to scalably manage multiple international sites and multilingual content. My role was pivotal in:

- Coordinating the Quality Assurance team
- Guiding a team of developers
- Defining and assigning tasks based on seniority
- Resolving roadblocks
- Ensuring the highest standards of code quality and testing

Developing accessible interfaces and ensuring everyone can have a usable and enjoyable user experience is an aspect of my work I deeply value.
